# Python for Data Science/Analyst

I made four files individually for you that discuss about:

* __Pandas__ : 
              Pandas is a Python library.Pandas is used to analyze data.
              It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.<br>
    __Why we use Pandas__:
                      Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant .<br>

* __Numpy__ :
              Numpy stands for Numerical Python.It is Python library used for working with arrays.It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.<br>
    __Why Use NumPy__:
                      In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.<br>

*__Matplotlib__: Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.<br>
* -__Seaborn__ :Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphic.
